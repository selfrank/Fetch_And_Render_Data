# Fetch And Render Data
Fetch And Render Data Coding Challenge

<b>About:</b>
This is a project that is part of the MIT xPro course. I utlized the Dog Api (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to practiced Fetching and Rendering Data in React. I chose to use their random image generator to set the query to the number of images to display. 
<br><b>Styles:</b>The pagination is set to display up to six images in three columns per page. Image width is restricted to 250px to standardize image appearance.
